Can I receive university credit for courses via GFA even if I have not received my high school diploma or passed the high school equivalency exam? Anyone can take these courses for ASU credit. However, if you\u2019d like to apply them toward a university degree, you will most likely need your high school diploma or proof that you\u2019ve passed the high school equivalency exam. This will also depend on the policies of the particular university to which you are applying. Is GFA for Freshman only? No. While GFA is perfect for incoming Freshman who want to enjoy a flexible, economically-viable model for taking Freshman-level courses, ambitious high school students who want a jump-start for their college career, or adult-learners returning to Freshman year after a hiatus, these introductory-level courses can be taken by anyone who wants to continue lifelong learning or by educators who want to share resources with students. Will GFA be extended to full college degrees? At this time, edX and ASU are focused on breaking down the barriers to successfully completing Freshman year. Will I get a letter grade on my Verified Certificate?  No. Your Verified Certificate is provided by edX to any student who completes an ID Verified course with a passing score (which varies, but will be clearly communicated via course materials) and will not feature a letter grade. Additionally, your Verified Certificate does not equal credit earned by ASU and you will still need to complete the steps required for credit conversion after you have earned the Verified Certificate. Will I get a letter grade on my Arizona State University transcript? Yes students who pursue the ID Verified track will receive a letter grade from ASU for the course and an official Arizona State University transcript if they pay the credit fee. Why is the estimated effort (18 hours per week) for these courses so high?  As a tier-1 public research university, ASU courses reflect the rigorous standards faculty members expect of their students. Given this, ASU recommends that for a 7.5 week course, students should be prepared to spend 6 hours a week on coursework for every 1 course credit. So for a 3 credit course, you should expect to spend approximately 18 hours of coursework per week. To what extent can I use credits earned via GFA to apply for a university degree? Arizona State University is an accredited university. Credits you earn via Global Freshman Academy will appear on an Arizona State University transcript and can be used as transfer credits anywhere ASU credits are accepted. We recommend that you check with your university to see whether ASU credits are accepted. While having earned ASU credits before you apply to a university will not guarantee your admittance, we believe many universities will value the hard work you have already completed. Will Arizona State University credits be accepted at international universities? University credits are typically recognized globally when they come from accredited institutions. Please check with your local university to see Arizona State University credits are accepted. After having taken a class and passed, what is the maximum allotted time to pay for the credit through ASU? You will be able to upgrade from a standard Verified Certificate to credit for one year after you successfully complete and pass the course. How will exam proctoring work? Students who have chosen the Verified track in the course will be asked to re-verify their ID upon launching any proctored exam in a GFA course. During a proctored exam, students will be monitored for the duration of the exam, and suspect behavior will be flagged and reviewed within 3-5 days of exam submission. A webcam will be required for proctored exams. Will GFA courses be offering any accommodations for people with learning disabilities? Especially during proctored exams? edX is committed to achieving full accessibility (WCAG 2.0 compliant or better) in the platform. We are continuously making accessibility improvements as we build out new capabilities and programs in order to meet this stringent standard. In terms of our proctoring solution, we are working with the software vendor and our university partners to ensure anyone taking courses for credit eligibility has an equitable experience. Accessibility is a key requirement for Arizona State University, as well. All Global Freshman Academy courses delivered through the edX platform will be ADA compliant and transcripts for hearing impaired students will be available for each video. What is the full list of courses offered via Global Freshman Academy? To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course. If I fail a class in GFA, will it be reflected on my transcript?  If you do not pass the course, you will not be eligible for the upgrade to credit. The failure will not appear anywhere on your ASU transcript. If I fail a GFA course, will I have the option to retake it at no additional cost?  With the Global Freshman Academy, you only pay for the course credit once you receive a passing grade. If you need to retake a course, you can do so at anytime but will be required to again pay the $45 ID Verification fee. If I already know the material of a course offered via GFA, would I have the option to test-out and receive ASU credit?  At this time, we do not offer an option to test out of the material offered in a GFA course. You will need to complete and pass all course material in order to be eligible for credit. Will you have courses in other subject areas? e.g., Education, Management, Psychics, Computer Science, etc. The Global Freshman Academy is a collection of freshman level courses that fulfill a specific set of general education requirements. The general studies focus areas will include Mathematical Studies, English, Humanities, Arts and Design, Social-Behavioral Sciences and Natural Sciences. To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course. How do I transfer the credits that I might earn through GFA? Once you complete your course(s) and are ready to transfer the credit earned, you will simply request your official transcript from ASU and submit to the the university to which you are applying. I have previously earned credits from other universities. Can I still take courses through GFA? We would first recommend checking with the university of your choice, whether that is ASU or elsewhere, to see which of the credits you already have would transfer in and what freshman year classes you may still need to take. This will give you a better idea of what GFA courses you would find beneficial.

In this course, you will learn how to use Object and Service Oriented design principles and your development team to increase system flexibility so you can efficiently run experiments at the technical level and also refine business processes and models. Good design enables a capability for experimentation that would otherwise be infeasible as it speeds up learning and decreases the development time needed to realize the necessary technical changes to drive the next experiment. This capability produces an increase in optionality and paths for innovation; and so overall increases business value. The course, part of both the Digital Product Management and Digital Leadership MicroMasters programs, addresses both the digital (technical) and social (people) infrastructures and the essential interfaces between them. Managing these interfaces requires designing varying capacities to transfer, translate or transform the knowledge being used to develop experiments. This course focuses on two aspects of the social infrastructure:  the capacity of the technical infrastructure to engage user and identify their needs; the ability to manage the interfaces between the development team and the technical infrastructure over time.  We will focus on how modular design is essential to project, process, and business model experimentation.

That\u2019s where this course comes in. \u201cThe Science of Happiness\u201d is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley\u2019s Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself\u2014the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond. What\u2019s more, \u201cThe Science of Happiness\u201d offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way. The course\u2019s co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal.

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of current social problems and how policy is formulated, alongside the ability to tell that story in a manner that drives an otherwise apathetic public into action. The goal of this online course is two-fold: 1) to teach people from all walks of life how to use journalism and media as an implement of social change; and 2) have those students become effective change agents themselves. This class is not theoretical \u2013 students should be prepared to dig in deep and make meaningful contributions to policy change on a global level. This course equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to produce solution-based journalism \u2013 stories that give equal weight to problems and solutions. Throughout the course, students will view examples of outstanding solution-based journalism. The majority of these stories focus on vulnerable children. The umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven policy areas concerning: communities, poverty, child protection, child maltreatment prevention, foster care, and the courts. At the same time, this course provides students with a platform to research, report on, and write about the policy and justice issues that fuel their own interests and passions, whether that involves immigration crises or poverty. Early on, students will share their interest areas with their classmates and start to share information and ideas. Students will then produce Final Stories on their topics of interest. Student work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact. Through precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis, students will substantively contribute to public discourse, and by virtue of that contribution drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues that vulnerable peoples across this globe face. With that experience, students will be better prepared to use journalism and media for social change in whatever field they explore beyond the class.

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.   This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.   While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you\u2019re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you\u2019ll join us.   This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC).

A model is a simplified representation of a real situation and modeling is the process of developing, analyzing and interpreting a model in order to help make better decisions. Models can be invaluable tools in managing and understanding the complexity and risk inherent in many business problems. As a result, models have become an increasingly important part of business at all levels from daily operations to strategic decision making. This course will help learners become intelligent users and consumers of these models. To this end, we will cover the basic elements of modeling \u2013 how to formulate a model and how to use and interpret the information a model produces. The course emphasizes \u201clearning by doing\u201d so that students will be expected to formulate, solve, and interpret a number of different optimization and simulation models using Excel spreadsheets. An important theme in the course is to understand the appropriate use of models in business and the potential pitfalls from using models incorrectly or inappropriately. The course has two distinct parts:  The first half of the course we will cover supervised learning techniques for regression and classification. In this framework, we possess an output or response that we wish to predict based on a set of inputs. We will discuss several fundamental methods for performing this task and algorithms for their optimization. Our approach will be more practically motivated, meaning we will fully develop a mathematical understanding of the respective algorithms, but we will only briefly touch on abstract learning theory. In the second half, we shift to unsupervised learning techniques. In these problems the end goal less clear-cut than predicting an output based on a corresponding input. We will cover three fundamental problems of unsupervised learning: data clustering, matrix factorization, and sequential models for order-dependent data. Some applications of these models include object recommendation and topic modeling.

Here, citizens play an important role amidst governments, companies, NGOs and researchers in creating social, technological and political innovations for achieving sustainability. Citizens can be co-creators of sustainable cities when they engage in city politics or in the design of the urban environment and its technologies and infrastructure. In addition, citizens influence and are influenced by the technologies and systems that they use every day. Sustainability is thus a result of the interplay between technology, policy and people\u2019s daily lives. Understanding this interplay is essential for creating sustainable cities. In this MOOC, we zoom in on Amsterdam, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Nairobi, Kampala and Suzhou as living labs for exploring the dynamics of co-creation for sustainable cities worldwide. We will address topics such as participative democracy and legitimacy, ICTs and big data, infrastructure and technology, and SMART technologies in daily life. This global scope will be used to illustrate why specific forms of co-creation are preferred in specific urban contexts. Moreover, we will investigate and compare these cities on three themes that have a vast effect on city life:   Water and waste Energy, air, food and mobility Green spaces and food  This MOOC will teach you about the dynamics of co-creation and the key principles of citizens interacting with service providing companies, technology and infrastructure developers, policy makers and researchers. You will gain an understanding of major types of co-creation and their interdependency with their socio-technical and political contexts. You will become equipped to indicate how you can use co-creation to develop innovative technologies, policy arrangements or social practices for a sustainable city in your own community. You will demonstrate this by developing an action plan, research proposal or project idea. Basic knowledge of sustainability in urban settings, urban environmental technology and urban management is assumed.

Do users have rights against surveillance? How does surveillance affect how we use cellular and other technologies? How does it affect our democratic institutions? Do you know that the metadata collected by a cellular network speaks volumes about its users? In this course you will explore all of these questions while investigating related issues in WiFi and Internet surveillance. The issues explored in this course are at the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology and will appeal to anyone interested in the technical, political, and moral questions inherent in the use of information networks.

And, cities generate more than 70% of the global emissions? Large cities and their hinterlands (jointly called metropolitan regions) greatly contribute to global urbanization and sustainability challenges, yet are also key to resolving these same challenges. If you are interested in the challenges of the 21st century metropolitan regions and how these can be solved from within the city and by its inhabitants, then this Sustainable Urban Development course is for you! There are no simple solutions to these grand challenges! Rather the challenges cities face today require a holistic, systemic and transdisciplinary approach that spans different fields of expertise and disciplines such as urban planning, urban design, urban engineering, systems analysis, policy making, social sciences and entrepreneurship. This MOOC is all about this integration of different fields of knowledge within the metropolitan context. The course is set up in a unique matrix format that lets you pursue your line of interest along a specific metropolitan challenge or a specific theme. Because we are all part of the challenges as well as the solutions, we encourage you to participate actively! You will have the opportunity to explore the living conditions in your own city and compare your living environment with that of the global community. You will discover possible solutions for your city\u2019s challenges and what it takes to implement these solutions. Your participation will also contribute to wider research into metropolitan regions as complex systems. We invite you to take the first steps in understanding the principles that will be essential to transform metropolitan regions into just, prosperous and sustainable places to live in! This course forms a part of the educational programme of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions.

How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues? No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message. In today\u2019s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners\u2019 values and emotions \u2013 it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively. When you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents \u2013 and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media \u2013 even at home. We invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself.  This course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates.

Understanding the complexity behind today\u2019s sophisticated railway systems will give you a better insight into how this safe and reliable transportation system works. We will show you the many factors which are involved and how multiple people, behind the scenes, have a daily task that enables you to get from home to work. Journey with us into the world of rail - a complex system that connects people, cities and countries. Railway systems entail much more than a train and a track. They are based on advanced technical and operational solutions, dealing with continuously changing demands for more efficient transport for both passengers and freight every day. Each system consists of many components that must be properly integrated: from trains, tracks, stations, signaling and control systems, through monitoring, maintenance and the impact on cities, landscape and people. This integration is the big challenge and the source of many train delays, inconvenient connections and other issues that impact our society. This engineering course attempts to tackle those issues by introducing you to a holistic approach to railway systems engineering. You will learn how the system components depend on each other to create a reliable, efficient and state-of-the-art network. We will address questions such as:  How do railways work and how did they evolve over time? What factors give rise to everyday issues? How do different components of the railway system interact? What is the effect of train stations and the network from an urban, social and economic point of view? What can be done to improve the monitoring and maintenance of tracks? How are timetables designed in a way that balances passenger demand with the capacity of the railway and is adaptable to handle unexpected disturbances? What can be done to prevent and deal with disturbances caused by external factors and how do they affect the whole rail system? How does the design of railways influence their performance over time?  A new serious game has been designed for this course to guide you through the process of decision making while building a rail network and maintaining it. Cities have to be connected in an ever-changing setting, dealing with wear, capacity, developments and disturbances. What choices do you make and how do they affect the performance of the system?

If you know the causes of these events and conditions, they can all be prevented. In this course, you will learn how to use the TU Delft mind-set to investigate the causes of such events so you can prevent them in the future. When, for instance, hundreds of hospital patients worldwide got infected after having gall bladder treatments, forensic engineering helped reveal how the design and use of the medical instruments could cause such widespread infections. As a result, changes were made to the instrument design and the procedural protocols in hospitals. Learning from failure in this case benefitted patient health and safety across the world. After taking this course you will have an understanding of failures and the investigation processes used to find their causes. You will learn how to apply lessons gained from investigating previous failures into new designs and procedures. The TU Delft Forensic Engineering mind-set involves recommendations for:  Data collection ranging from desk studies (theoretical/predicted performance of structures) to field investigations (actual performance of failed structures) Hypothesis generation techniques for technical and procedural causes of failure Hypothesis testing for engineering aspects of forensic cases Reporting findings about the most likely causes and consequences Improving engineering designs based on lessons learned from forensic cases  The course uses case studies from Building Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Biomechanical Engineering. All of these provide great examples that illustrate the approaches and highlight technical and procedural causes of failure.

Would worker-managed firms make the same decisions as their capitalist counterparts? Could such an economy be efficient? What policies could be deployed to promote a cooperative sector? This course will focus on these central questions as we discuss the internal impact of employee ownership; productivity, governance and management, as well as the external impact of employee ownership; spillovers for health, democracy, and the local economy. We will also discuss the simple economic theory of the labour-managed firm. Cooperatives have many attractive features, including high productivity. But they account for a relatively small proportion of GDP in most economies. We analyse possible reasons for this apparent paradox. There is widespread interest around the world in cooperatives as an alternative to the capitalist corporation, particularly since the financial crash of 2008. Economics and other social sciences sharpen the debate on cooperatives. After taking this course, you will be better prepared to participate in public discussion on cooperatives, join a cooperative, or even start a new one.

With this in mind, it is no surprise that one fourth of the CEOs of the world\u2019s 100 largest corporations have an engineering degree. Solving these global problems requires leaders who, in the first place, are comfortable with technology, models and quantitative analyses -- Leaders who see systems instead of isolated problems. However, simply understanding technology is not enough. Successful leaders today must have both the ideas and the know-how to put these ideas into action by working collaboratively with others, winning their hearts and minds. We need leaders who know how to seize opportunities in a networked world, and can mobilize people and other stakeholders for large-scale change. Leaders who lead fulfilling lives and who are able to move themselves and others from the \u2018me\u2019 to the \u2018we\u2019. Leaders who are long-term oriented and who deliver economic profit, while also making positive contributions to society and the environment. We call these leaders \u2018sustainable leaders\u2019. This course has three parts:  In the first part, you will explore the context that leaders are facing, building an understanding of the complexities of global and business challenges. You will discover the ambiguities and the many stakeholders that leaders must consider when making their choices. You will get a sense of effective leadership practices. In the second part, you will discover your \u201cwho am I\u201d through personal and group exercises. You will create a \u201cPersonal Charter\u201d that can serve as a life-long guide, helping you, as a leader, to make important choices in your personal and professional life. In the third part, we will bring the knowledge of the context and yourself together. We will translate the insights of this course into a leadership model and you will discover what sustainable leaders do. We will offer you frameworks to help you make your own career choices. We will finally help you to \u2018sell\u2019 yourself as a leader.

Are you dealing with measurements or big data, but are you unsure about how to proceed? This is the course that teaches you how to find the best estimates of the unknown parameters from noisy observations. You will also learn how to assess the quality of your results. TU Delft\u2019s approach to observation theory is world leading and based on decades of experience in research and teaching in geodesy and the wider geosciences. The theory, however, can be applied to all the engineering sciences where measurements are used to estimate unknown parameters. The course introduces a standardized approach for parameter estimation, using a functional model (relating the observations to the unknown parameters) and a stochastic model (describing the quality of the observations). Using the concepts of least squares and best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE), parameters are estimated and analyzed in terms of precision and significance. The course ends with the concept of overall model test, to check the validity of the parameter estimation results using hypothesis testing. Emphasis is given to develop a standardized way to deal with estimation problems. Most of the course effort will be on examples and exercises from different engineering disciplines, especially in the domain of Earth Sciences.

However, new technologies raise ethical questions, have serious implications for society and the environment and pose new risks, often unknown and unknowable before the new technologies reach maturity. For example, how can we make sure that \u201csmart cities\u201d and other data-based services strike a balance between the benefits the service provides and the risks it poses to the security of citizens? What are the ethical questions surrounding self-driving vehicles or autonomous weapons? What are the health risks of nanotechnologies? All these create new risks and raise serious ethical questions. The challenge is to innovate in a way that benefits both companies and society \u2013 to innovate responsibly. This course provides both a theoretical and practical framework for assessing and designing responsible innovations, combined with real-world examples. The first part (weeks 1 and 2) of the course focuses on ethical questions and concerns, such as: a fair distribution of costs and benefits, moral obligations and individual and collective responsibilities. The second part (weeks 3 and 4) deals with (unknown) risks and safety of new technologies including a number of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. The last part of the course (weeks 5, 6 and 7) is about the management of responsible innovations and evolving a new, value driven, design process. Case studies during the course include nanotechnology, self-driving vehicles, smart meters for electricity, autonomous weapons, nuclear energy and CO2capture and storage together with their related ethical and safety concerns. Affordable innovations for low-income groups and emerging markets are also covered in the course. The course includes a free e-book.

Delivered by four leading research teams, it will provide you with the economic concepts, measurement approaches and data analytics to make better security and IT decisions, as well as understand the forces that shape the security decisions of other actors in the ecosystem of information goods and services. Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability to computer hackers and increasing crime, solutions must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. This requires a technical comprehension of security threats combined with an economic perspective to uncover the strategies employed by cyber hackers, attackers and defenders. The course covers five main areas:  Introduction to key concepts in security economics. Here, we provide an overview of how information security is shaped by economic mechanisms, such as misaligned incentives, information asymmetry, and externalities. Measuring cybersecurity. We introduce state of the art security and IT metrics and conceptualize the characteristics of a security metric, its challenges and advantages. Economics of information security investment. We discuss and apply different economic models that help determine the costs and benefits of security investments in network security. Security market failures. We discuss market failures that may lead to cybersecurity investment levels that are insufficient from society\u2019s perspective and other forms of unsafe behaviour in cyber space. Behavioural economics for information security, policy and regulation. We discuss available economic tools to better align the incentives for cybersecurity, including better security metrics, cyber insurance/risk transfer, information sharing, and liability assignment.  After finishing this course, you will be able to apply economic analysis and data analytics to cybersecurity. You will understand the role played by incentives on the adoption and effectiveness of security mechanisms, and on the design of technical, market-based, and regulatory solutions to different security threats. Sound understanding of the economics of cybersecurity as a systems discipline, from security policies (modelling what ought to be protected) to mechanisms (how to implement the protection goals)  How to design security metrics to capture information security issues  How the design of effective policies to enhance and maintain cybersecurity must take into account a complex set of incentives facing not only the providers and users of the Internet and computer software, but also those of potential attackers  Enroll in the latest computer science courses covering important topics in artificial intelligence, cyber security, software engineering, and big data.

The practical applications of this principle are quite profound, and already within the last eight years they have lead to prediction and discovery of a vast range of new materials with exotic properties that were considered to be impossible before. What will you gain from this course?  Learn about the variety of subtopics in topological materials, their relation to each other and to the general principles. Learn to follow active research on topology, and critically understand it on your own. Acquire skills required to engage in research on your own, and to minimize confusion that often arises even among experienced researchers.  What is the focus of this course?  Applications of topology in condensed matter based on bulk-edge correspondence. Special attention to the most active research topics in topological condensed matter: theory of topological insulators and Majorana fermions, topological classification of \"grand ten\u201d symmetry classes, and topological quantum computation Extensions of topology to further areas of condensed matter, such as photonic and mechanical systems, topological quantum walks, topology in fractionalized systems, driven or dissipative systems.  What tools does this course use?  Simple thought experiments that rely on considerations of symmetry or continuity under adiabatic deformations Computer simulations similar to those used in actual research will give a more detailed and visual understanding of the involved concepts Dissecting research papers that teaches you to simply understand the idea even in the rather involved ones.  This course is a joint effort of Delft University of Technology, QuTech, NanoFront, University of Maryland, and Joint Quantum Institute. FAQs Are there any books that are required for the course? No, the course will only rely on materials and software freely available online. Is it possible to get credit for this course at my university? Not by default, but we invite anyone to use the course materials as a basis for a graduate course, with course materials studied as preparation and followed by a classroom discussion. Such courses are planned at universities of Copenhagen, Delft, Leiden, and University of Maryland. Following such a course will obviously give you credit points. Would it not be better to take a more formal approach, and to describe the math in a more rigorous and systematic way? While advanced math is certainly relevant for some researchers, in our experience it is the simple things that are the most confusing. We aim for the course to stay accessible and relevant to advanced undergraduate/beginner graduate students, both the theorists and experimentalists. I do not know enough about condensed matter physics, but I have attended an exciting talk/read a cool article, and I'd like to learn more. Would the course be useful for me? We are not sure. On the one hand, we will aim the course at people familiar with basic condensed matter physics and the necessary math, hence we will always assume that we don't need to explain e.g. band structures from scratch. However, a good share of the course materials are just discussions which would give you some sort of overview and understanding what this is all about. Why didn't you discuss my favorite topic, which is certainly relevant and exciting? Hey, that's a great idea! We aim to start from covering the basic questions, and then let the course evolve together with the field. So if you want, please help us by preparing the materials that would be helpful for the course, and they will become a bonus topic.

After a short study of ultrasound imaging, you will learn about the different X-ray imaging techniques. The understanding of the interaction of X-rays with tissue will lead to the study of three different techniques:  Computed Tomography (CT) Emission Tomography Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  This course shows how existing physical principles transcend into bio-imaging and establish an important link into life sciences, illustrating the contributions physics can make to life sciences. Practical examples will be shown to illustrate the respective imaging modality, its use, premise and limitations, and biological safety will be touched upon. During this course, you will develop a good understanding of the mechanisms leading to tissue contrast of the bio-imaging modalities covered in this course, including the inner workings of the scanner and how they define the range of possible biomedical applications. You will be able to judge which imaging modality is adequate for specific life science needs and to understand the limits and promises of each modality. To learn more about biomedical imaging, join us in the second part of this course Biomedical Imaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Understand the main imaging concepts that characterize the quality of imaging techniques for Signal (SNR) and Contrast (CNR).  Understand the essential principles of ultrasound, X-ray imaging (CT), SPECT, PET.  For each of the above techniques, be aware of the factors limiting the image quality.

As cities are currently hosts to half of the world\u2019s population, the role played by urban infrastructures in the delivery of services (such as energy, transport and water) becomes crucial. The management and governance of such complex socio-technical systems becomes vital to ensuring their performance. In this course we look at the economic, social, political, and technological dimensions of urban infrastructure management. Note that this it is not an intensely technical course, but rather a course in the area of (public) management. In addition to covering the basic principles and main schools of thought in managing and governing urban infrastructures, we also focus on two, particularly vital urban infrastructures, namely energy and transport. The course is structured into 4 blocks. The first block provides a solid foundation for understanding urban infrastructures: why are they important? How do they function? Why are they different from other large socio-technical systems? The second block explores the main challenges as well as the main schools of thought in managing and governing urban infrastructures. The third and fourth blocks are dedicated to developing a deeper understanding of urban energy and urban transport management and governance respectively. Block 3 will offer an introduction to urban energy systems, focusing, in particular, on the unique characteristics of these systems. Block 4 will do the same for urban transportation systems and highlight, in particular, the emerging integrated approach to urban mobility.

Smart cities, such as Zurich and Boston, consist of human-made structures or environments that are, in some capacity, monitored, metered, networked and controlled. With this functionality, combined with stationary sensors and mobile devices, data and information have become the new building materials of future cities. Using this data, citizens are now beginning to influence the design of future cities and the re-design of existing ones. In this architecture course, you will learn the basics of information cities and urban science research, as well as how dynamic behavior and citizen-driven learning differentiate the responsive city from the smart city. The cities we present and develop in this course use the stocks and flows of information as the main drivers of change. To deepen your knowledge of smart cities and give a perspective on the future of these cities, we also introduce the concept of citizen design science, a combination of citizen science, urban design, and cognitive design computing. Participants will furthermore have unique access to a design research platform for citizen design science. The intelligent use of data and information is at the core of this course, and these concepts will be the next generation of participatory design and design computing environments. This course is part of the \u201cFuture Cities\u201d XSeries, and builds on the experiences from our first two urban MOOCs: Future Cities and Livability in Future Cities. By the end of the course you will be able to:  Understand the concept of smart cities, why these are still prototypes and what the challenges are.

Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. \u201cFuture Cities\u201d aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.

Responsive citizens use smart technology to contribute to planning, design and management of their cities. Responsive cities are about bringing cities back to their citizens. Responsive cities change the way the technology of a smart city is used. The first Smart Cities were technology driven and they produced large amounts of data from fixed or centrally controlled sensors. But by now, the citizens and their mobile phones have taken the leading role in direct data generation. Rather than using data that are centrally collected and stored, you will see platforms on which the citizens place the data and the information they decide to share.

E non c\u2019\u00e8 posizione teoretica, neppure il parmenidismo, che non possa ritrovare attualit\u00e0 addirittura mediatica. Il superamento storico non vuol dire \u201coblio\u201d, n\u00e9 comporta mai un definitivo superamento teorico.

Understanding Philosophy What is philosophy? This course explores the development of philosophical thought in four major stages, from antiquity to the present day. Your journey takes you to 12 stops, and each will serve to enhance your knowledge of philosophy, remembering, as Pierre Bayle said, that no philosophical sect is ever really defeated or surpassed and they are always poised to make a comeback.   Similarly, philosophical theories never lose their relevance, even Parmenides may find space in today\u2019s media. New theoretical developments do not consign older theories to \u201cthe scrapheap of time\u201d. Quite simply, the newer theories show us that we can learn from our mistakes, or our mistakes can inform others and that nothing - even doctrines that deny the idea of constant flux \u2013 ever returns completely unchanged.

Un testo scritto nel 1300 che affronta temi ancora oggi attuali, e che pu\u00f2 rendere l'uomo del nostro tempo pi\u00f9 vicino \u00aba quell'amore che move il sole e l\u2019altre stelle.   Questo corso affronta non solo la poesia presente nel percorso che il poeta-personaggio Dante ha tracciato nella sua opera quale viaggio dall\u2019umano al \"divino\", ma anche la parte scientifica dell\u2019opera. Quest\u2019ultima ha avuto in genere una minore frequentazione critica rispetto all\u2019universo poetico. Essa, infatti, risulta scarsamente frequentata dal critico letterario, mentre \u00e8 stata oggetto di studio da parte di scienziati di ieri e del nostro tempo.   In questo viaggio nella Commedia dantesca sarai accompagnato per mano da personaggi come Beatrice, Pier delle Vigne, Ulisse ma anche dal pi\u00f9 grande dei nostri scienziati, Albert Einstein per comprendere come l\u2019esatta descrizione del cosmo fatta da Dante Alighieri nel 1300 \u00e8 stata poi dimostrata dalla scienza moderna.   In tal modo la Commedia riesce meglio a suggerire al lettore il valore del pensiero dantesco offrendo ai lettori del XXI secolo un esempio di come la poesia e la scienza non devono vivere in \u201ccamere separate\u201d, ma costituiscono l\u2019unit\u00e0 del sapere universale.   Dante: between poetry and science Dante\u2019s comedy is one of the most widely-translated and published works of all time. Written in 1300, it deals with themes which are still relevant today, and which makes today\u2019s generations feel closer \u00abto that love that moves the sun and other stars. This course looks at the poetry in the journey that the poet-character Dante takes his readers on from the human to the \u201cdivine\u201d. It will focus on the scientific aspects, which have, in general, received less interest on the part of critics. Although largely ignored by literary critics, Dante has been widely studied by scientists both past and present.   You will be escorted on your journey through Dante\u2019s comedy by characters like Beatrice, Pier delle Vigne and Ulysses, but also by some of the most famous scientists, like Albert Einstein, to see how Dante Alighieri\u2019s description of the cosmos in 1300 was later verified by modern science.   In this way, the Comedy succeeds in conveying how precious Dante's thoughts are and shows 21st century readers that science and poetry do not have to be separated but constitute the unity of universal knowledge.

L'uso del passato rinforza, da sempre, le diverse identit\u00e0 regionali e crea un senso di appartenenza ad una comune Romanitas. Per capire come questa 'doppia' identit\u00e0 funzioni \u00e8 necessario leggere con attenzione gli scrittori latini tardi, studiare come essi si relazionino con i grandi auctores, come l\u2019altro, il diverso, il barbaro vengano disegnati nelle loro pagine.   Evitando naturalmente anacronismi riflettendo attraverso le pagine della letteratura dell\u2019epoca, espressione di una societ\u00e0 multiculturale e inclusiva quale quella romana, possiamo trarre suggestioni interessanti circa i concetti di Alterit\u00e0 e Convivenza quali si formano nell'immaginario dell'uomo occidentale.    Latin literature in the Post-Augustan period   Latin literature in the I century AD needs to be explained in the light of the literary currents that preceded it. But it is also important to focus on those issues which were taking root at that time \u2013 the idea of a Roman identity, cultural diversity and relating to different peoples; phenomena that become particularly significant in late Antiquity.   Reference to the past was always used to reinforce regional identity, and a sense of belonging to the Romanitas community. To understand how this \u201cdual\u201d identity worked, we need to study Latin writers from the late Antiquity, and see how they relate to other authors, and how they handle the descriptions of diverse peoples and barbarians in their works.   Avoiding anachronisms, we will use our study of Latin literature as an expression of a multicultural and inclusive Roman society to draw interesting conclusions about the concepts of Otherness and Coexistence that are relevant to Western populations today.

Nelle lezioni, questa vicenda verr\u00e0 affrontata partendo, ogni volta, da un avvenimento concretamente o simbolicamente significativo dei diversi periodi e problemi.   Nel nostro viaggio, emerger\u00e0 una possibile interpretazione della storia d\u2019Italia, non di \"come sono andate davvero le cose\". Un'interpretazione che ruota attorno a due assunti apparentemente contraddittori. Per un verso, se la si considera nel lungo periodo, l'Italia \u00e8 un Paese di grandi successi. Era governata da pr\u00ecncipi di periferia e regimi autoritari e nel 1861 diventa uno stato nazionale che si ispira ai modelli del liberalismo europeo. Per altro verso, quella italiana \u00e8 una storia di spaccature interne, squilibri territoriali, conflitti sanguinosi, guerre civili. Basti pensare allo scontro tra fascisti e socialisti nel primo dopoguerra, alla stagione del terrorismo e perfino a quella \"guerra civile fredda\" tra berlusconiani e antiberlusconiani che ha segnato l'ultimo ventennio. Insieme cercheremo una risposta, che pu\u00f2 risiedere nella stabilit\u00e0 politica e sociale del paese, risultato della lunga tradizione governativa e parlamentare del \"centrismo\", e di una sapiente governance delle periferie, soprattutto meridionali, da parte del ceto politico centrale.     The making of Italy   This course looks at the history of Italy, which dates back 150 years. The lessons in this course will explore the making of Italy, using a concrete or symbolically significant event for each period or problem.   Our interpretation revolves around two apparently conflicting assumptions. On the one hand, if we look at Italy in the long-term, it is a very successful country. It was governed by provincial princes and authoritarian regimes until, in 1861, it became a nation state inspired by models of European liberalism. On the other hand, Italy\u2019s history is punctuated by internal strife, geographical divides, bloody conflicts and civil wars. Good examples are the post-war conflict between fascists and socialists, the period of terrorism and the \u201ccivil cold war\u201d between pro and anti Berlusconi factions that marked the last two decades.

Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we will consider a number of Dickinson\u2019s poems\u2014many seemingly in tension with one another\u2014concerned with Nature, Art, the Self, and Darkness. We will travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886. Distinguished guests for this module include NBA athlete Jason Collins, dancers Damian Woetzel and Charles \u201cLil Buck\u201d Riley, and President and CEO of the New America Foundation Anne Marie Slaughter, among others.   Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.

We will study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation. Traveling to the homes and workplaces of Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens; to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where the institution of American Modernism was born; and even exploring the River Thames in the London of Eliot's THE WASTE LAND, we will see the sites that witnessed\u2014and cultivated\u2014the rise of American Modernism.

In this course, you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian. Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we\u2019ll examine some of history\u2019s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations. The first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination\u2014perspective drawing and architectural typology\u2014are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history. In the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture\u2019s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction\u2014glass and steel, reinforced concrete\u2014are crucial agents of change. But a society\u2019s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture\u2019s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture. The final set of modules confronts architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations.

Our main goals are to reduce the stigma that exists around addiction, help prevent overdose deaths and encourage people to learn about the multiple pathways to treatment.

All organisms, from single-celled algae to complex multicellular organisms like us, are made up of cells. In this course, you will learn the how and why of biology by exploring the function of the molecular components of cells, and how these cellular components are organized in a complex hierarchy. This course is designed to explore the fundamentals of cell biology. The overarching goal is for learners to understand, from a human-centered perspective, that cells are evolving ensembles of macromolecules that in turn form complex communities in tissues, organs, and multicellular organisms. We will focus, in particular, on the mitochondrion, the organelle that powers the cell. In this context, we will look at the processes of cell metabolism. Finally, we will examine the F1F0 ATP synthase, the molecular machine that is responsible for the synthesis of most of the ATP that your cells require to do work. To underscore the importance of cell biology to our lives, we will address questions of development and disease and implications of science in society. By the end of four weeks, we hope learners will have a deep intuition for the functional logic of a cell. Together we will ask how do things work within a cell, why do they work the way they do, and how are we impacted? Join us as we explore the extraordinary and wonderfully dynamic world of the cell.

In the R Basics course, we learn the basic building blocks of R. As done in all our courses, we use motivating case studies, we ask specific questions, and learn by answering these through data analysis. Our assessments use code checking technology that will permit you to get hands-on practice during the courses. Throughout the series, we will be using the R software environment. You will learn R, statistical concepts, and data analysis techniques simultaneously. In this course, we will introduce the necessary basic R syntax to get you going. However, rather than cover every R skill you need, we introduce just enough so you can continue learning in the next courses, which will provide more in depth coverage. We believe that you can better retain R knowledge when you learn it to solve a specific problem. The motivating question in this course relates to crime in the United States and we provide a relevant dataset. You will learn some basic R skills to permit us to answer specific questions about differences across the different states. HarvardX has partnered with DataCamp for all assignments.

Through a series of case studies, you\u2019ll learn:  How standardized test makers use functions to analyze the difficulty of test questions; How economists model interaction of price and demand using rates of change, in a historical case of subway ridership; How an x-ray is different from a CT-scan, and what this has to do with integrals; How biologists use differential equation models to predict when populations will experience dramatic changes, such as extinction or outbreaks; How the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model was created to answer a biological puzzle; How statisticians use functions to model data, like income distributions, and how integrals measure chance; How Einstein\u2019s Energy Equation, E=mc2 is an approximation to a more complicated equation.  With real practitioners as your guide, you\u2019ll explore these situations in a hands-on way: looking at data and graphs, writing equations, doing calculus computations, and making educated guesses and predictions. This course provides a unique supplement to a course in single-variable calculus. Key topics include application of derivatives, integrals and differential equations, mathematical models and parameters. This course is for anyone who has completed or is currently taking a single-variable calculus course (differential and integral), at the high school (AP or IB) or college/university level. You will need to be familiar with the basics of derivatives, integrals, and differential equations, as well as functions involving polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms.

Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation.    We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life \u2014 agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.   This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.    The course\u2019s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.

We start with RNA-seq data analysis covering basic concepts of RNA-seq and a first look at FASTQ files. We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing RNA-seq at the gene-level: counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level: inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples. The course will end with a brief description of the basic steps for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, from read alignment, to peak calling, and assessing differential binding patterns across multiple samples. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.

They have become a key tool for researchers who study the effects of treatments, exposures, and policies. By summarizing and communicating assumptions about the causal structure of a problem, causal diagrams have helped clarify apparent paradoxes, describe common biases, and identify adjustment variables. As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.   The first part of this course is comprised of five lessons that introduce the theory of causal diagrams and describe its applications to causal inference. The fifth lesson provides a simple graphical description of the bias of conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment in the presence of time-varying covariates. The second part of the course presents a series of case studies that highlight the practical applications of causal diagrams to real-world questions from the health and social sciences.

No one wants to do research that can\u2019t be reproduced. Thus, this course is really for anyone who is doing any data intensive research. While many of us come from a biomedical background, this course is for a broad audience of data scientists.   To meet the needs of the scientific community, this course will examine the fundamentals of methods and tools for reproducible research. Led by experienced faculty from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, you will participate in six modules that will include several case studies that illustrate the significant impact of reproducible research methods on scientific discovery.   This course will appeal to students and professionals in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science. The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project.   We\u2019ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing.   Consider this course a survey of best practices: we\u2019d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it\u2019ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues.

Caso esta tend\u00eancia se mantenha, a taxa de urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o em 2030 ser\u00e1 de cerca de 90%, fazendo da regi\u00e3o a mais urbanizada do planeta. Essa tend\u00eancia consolida a cidade como o centro do desenvolvimento econ\u00f4mico e humano da regi\u00e3o. A cidade est\u00e1 criando trabalho, est\u00e1 inovando, est\u00e1 repensando seus sistemas de sa\u00fade e educa\u00e7\u00e3o, transporte, est\u00e1 fazendo frente \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as do clima, est\u00e1 abrindo espa\u00e7os para o debate e a socializa\u00e7\u00e3o. Para que esse dinamismo possa traduzir-se em um fen\u00f4meno exitoso, a cidade deve aprender a planejar seu presente pensando em seu futuro, buscando o equil\u00edbrio entre crescimento econ\u00f4mico, a inclus\u00e3o social e o respeito ao meio ambiente. \u00c9, portanto, responsabilidade das cidades melhorar a qualidade de vida das gera\u00e7\u00f5es presentes sem comprometer o bem estar das gera\u00e7\u00f5es futuras. Com o objetivo de responder a este desafio, o BID criou um curso que busca fortalecer os conhecimentos e capacidades dos participantes em gerir o desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel de suas cidades. E para isso, o curso parte da premissa que a sustentabilidade das cidades s\u00f3 ser\u00e1 alcan\u00e7ada por meio de uma perspectiva integrada e intersetorial; uma perspectiva integral, onde se trabalhe de maneira conjunta os desafios econ\u00f4micos, fiscais, urbanos, ambientais, institucionais e de governabilidade das cidades junto com uma perspectiva intersetorial, onde as diferentes \u00e1reas e n\u00edveis de governo se coordenem e que se articulem com o setor privado e com a sociedade civil. Com o objetivo de entender melhor essa perspectiva, o curso analisa a situa\u00e7\u00e3o, os desafios setoriais e intersetoriais que as cidades encontram na gest\u00e3o das principais \u00e1reas de sua compet\u00eancia: finan\u00e7as subnacionais, desenvolvimento produtivo, planejamento urbano, transporte, seguran\u00e7a cidad\u00e3, \u00e1gua, ar etc. Desta forma, com o objetivo de abordar o planejamento do desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel das cidades m\u00e9dias latino americanas, o curso apresenta a \u201cIniciativa Cidades Emergentes e Sustent\u00e1veis\u201d, uma ferramenta de gest\u00e3o que permite dar sentido ao trabalho anal\u00edtico das dimens\u00f5es/desafios de forma integrada. Assim como na Am\u00e9rica Latina e no Caribe, o Brasil possui grandes desafios ambientais, urbanos e fiscais para a sustentabilidade de suas cidades. Dentre eles se destacam os altos \u00edndices de viol\u00eancia - 25,8 mortes violentas por 100 mil habitantes segundo o F\u00f3rum Brasileiro de Seguran\u00e7a P\u00fablica; a desigualdade urbana, uma vez que o pa\u00eds \u00e9 o 4\u00ba mais desigual da Am\u00e9rica Latina e Caribe; e a vulnerabilidade diante de desastres naturais, onde se calcula, por exemplo, que a reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o das cidades cariocas devastadas pelas enchentes e pelos deslizamentos de 2011 custou 1,3% do PIB do estado do Rio de Janeiro; ou ainda, degrada\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, com um \u00edndice de 63% de esgoto sendo lan\u00e7ado nos corpos h\u00eddricos sem nenhum tratamento, segundo o MCidades.

If you have ever felt crippled by anxiety, this four-module course is your first step to developing the psychological skills that will help you perform at your best under pressure. Created by Juilliard\u2019s Dr. Noa Kageyama, whose performance psychology classes are a favorite among Juilliard music students, the course combines applied exercises, insights gleaned from interviews with renowned performers, and research in performance psychology and motor learning.   You will learn how to overcome your fears around performing in front of an audience and discover how universal the experience of performance anxiety is amongst musicians at all levels \u2013 from beginner to professional. The three psychological skills covered in this course are:  Practice that Sticks; Beating Anxiety; Getting (and Staying) in the Zone.  Why peak performances are not random chance occurrences, but the result of a specific kind of practice, and the utilization of a combination of mental skills  That performance anxiety is something nearly all performers experience - but that it need not be debilitative, as there are ways to overcome fears about performing by changing one\u2019s approach to practicing  The key difference between two essential and complementary types of practice  How to apply theoretical knowledge of performance psychology to actionable exercises that will enable you to experience the difference mental skills training makes when performing in high-pressure situations  Effective communication skills are essential for success in the digital age.

Both courses provide a solid foundation in the area of reliable distributed computing, including the main concepts, results, models and algorithms in the field. In order to ensure that IT infrastructures - a key engine of operations for any organization - operate at full capacity and efficiency, it is vital to understand its core: distributed algorithms. To achieve this, the infrastructure itself must be reliable and resilient. This course continues on the foundations of distributed algorithms, introduced in ID2203.1x, and builds on these concepts at a higher level of complexity to develop the skills needed to build and maintain reliable and efficient distributed systems. ID2203.2x covers specific advanced abstractions and algorithms including sequence consensus and multi-Paxos; atomic broadcast and replicated state machines. It also covers dynamic reconfiguration of services; the use of physical clocks in distributed systems; the CAP theorem, and weaker consistency models, including eventual consistency and conflict-free replicated data-types. Students will experiment and develop a variety of distributed algorithms in an interactive, engaging programming environment using the Scala programming language. They will be guided throughout the programming assignments and provided with intuitive examples to help them get started. To complete the course with a full grade (100%) students are required to answer the graded quizzes provided every week, as well as the programming assignments. Agreeing on an incremental sequence of values and the related multi-Paxos algorithm  Atomic broadcast and replicated state machines for fault-tolerant services  Dynamic reconfiguration of distributed services  The timed asynchronous model of distributed systems, and the use of physical clocks  Efficient distributed algorithms based on the timed asynchronous model  Relaxed consistency models and the CAP theorem, including various consistency models and conflict-free replicated data types  Enroll in the latest computer science courses covering important topics in artificial intelligence, cyber security, software engineering, and big data.

Unfortunately, recent events have shown that this phenomenon is becoming increasingly complex, especially with respect to certain legal issues, for instance relating to:  the definition of armed conflicts when foreign forces are fighting armed groups located in the territory of another State. the definition of combatants when terrorists are involved in the hostilities. the targeting of certain objects which are used for both military and civilian purposes. the detention by rebels of State armed forces. the involvement and status of UN peacekeepers involved in combat operations. the application of the law of occupation to international organizations.  This law course will help you to understand these complex legal issues by teaching you basic norms governing armed conflicts, also known as \u2018International Humanitarian Law\u2019 (\u2018IHL\u2019). This course provides essential theoretical and practical knowledge for students, researchers and academics who wish to specialize in this field. It is also dedicated to professionals, including members of NGOs, involved in armed conflict situations, or members of armed forces. Starting with the sources and subjects of IHL, as well as its scope of application, the course will address the main substantive norms of IHL governing: the conduct of hostilities; the protection afforded to persons in the hands of the enemy; occupation; and implementation of IHL. We will discuss questions such as:  who and what can be targeted by the enemy. which weapons can be used. which method of warfare is authorized. who enjoys protection and what type of protection. which norms apply in non international armed conflicts.  We will also deal with the different ways through which IHL can be implemented and how belligerents may be held accountable for violations of its rules when committing war crimes or crimes against humanity. These critical issues will be addressed in light of recent practice, including the fight against ISIS and Al-Qaeda in different regions of the world, as well as other recent conflicts such as those occurring in Armenia, Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, RDC, Syria, The Soudan, Ukraine or Yemen. Older ongoing conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian one, will also be addressed.

Do you recall recent cases such as Philip Morris v Uruguay and Vattenfall v Germany? In the aftermath of these high profile cases and in the context of the negotiation of new international investment agreements, like the CETA and the TPP, local populations, policy-makers and NGOs have come to realize the societal importance of international investment law. Passionate and sometimes ill-informed discussions have resulted from this realisation. They have focused on the features of international investment law, which has traditionally granted rights to foreign investors to foster States\u2019 economic development. Central to these discussions are the issues of:  the balance between the protection of foreign investors and the right of host States to regulate in order to protect public welfare objectives; the duties and obligations of foreign investors; the promotion of sustainable development in international investment law; the legitimacy of arbitration tribunals to decide on disputes between host States and foreign investors; the coherence of arbitration practice.  Learning and understanding the features and dynamics of international investment law is key not only for international lawyers and policy-makers, but it is also important knowledge for all well-informed citizens. In this law course, you will:  discover the history of international investment law and understand the dynamics which shape its evolution; learn the objectives of international investment law and the specific rights international investment agreements grant to foreign investors; discover how those rights have been interpreted by arbitration tribunals; master the features and functions of investor-state arbitration; understand why international investment law and investor-state arbitration are currently the subject of criticism and be able to assess the soundness of this criticism; gain insight into the content of treaties newly concluded, and be able to assess how they address the issues of the right of host States to regulate, of foreign investors\u2019 obligations and of the legitimacy of arbitration tribunals.  At the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to:  relate the history and evolution of international investment law and comment on current controversies and criticisms;  analyse the law and practice of international investment law;  understand the functioning of investment arbitration.

This EU and Human Rights course teaches the basics of human rights, placing the EU at the centre of investigation. The course will examine a number of key questions:  What factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people\u2019s human rights in the EU and the world? Which actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations. In key policy sectors in which the EU is active, what is on balance the impact of the EU? Examples include trade, development, migration, social policy or international crisis management.  All of the course activities aim to improve your understanding of how the EU, alone or in combination with other local or global, state or non-state actors, can better promote and uphold human rights worldwide. The course is intended for anyone interested in human rights and the EU, human rights law, European law, European Studies, international relations, global governance, etc. It is divided into four modules:  The EU and Human Rights: Value Promotion and Coherence Promoting Human Rights inside the EU Promoting Human Rights in EU External Action Capitalising on Success and Remedying Flaws  This course is taught by leading academics, and the content is illustrated through interviews of practitioners in the field of the EU and human rights.

Therefore, such motions must be modeled as stochastic processes, for which exact predictions are no longer possible. This is in stark contrast to the deterministic motion of planets and stars, which can be perfectly predicted using celestial mechanics. This course is an introduction to stochastic processes through numerical simulations, with a focus on the proper data analysis needed to interpret the results. We will use the Jupyter (iPython) notebook as our programming environment. It is freely available for Windows, Mac, and Linux through the Anaconda Python Distribution. The students will first learn the basic theories of stochastic processes. Then, they will use these theories to develop their own python codes to perform numerical simulations of small particles diffusing in a fluid. Finally, they will analyze the simulation data according to the theories presented at the beginning of course.

Mathematicians from ancient times to the 21st century have been working on prime numbers, as they're one of the most mysterious and important subjects in mathematics.   In this course, I will present several attractive topics on prime numbers. You will learn basic concepts of prime numbers from the beginning. They obey mysterious laws. Some laws are easily verified by hand, some laws were discovered 100 years ago, and some laws are yet to be discovered. Surprisingly, prime numbers are also applied to cryptography today. You will also learn how to construct practical cryptosystems using prime numbers.   The original course \"Fun with Prime Numbers\" was first offered in 2015 and attracted many students. This course in 2017 will be offered as its refined and upgraded version. All the lecture videos will be renewed, and a new topic on cryptography will be added so as to enliven and satisfy even the students who took the previous course.   No previous knowledge of prime numbers is required in this course. Calculating with a pen and paper, you will explore the mysterious world of prime numbers. The course is designed to encourage you to attack unsolved problems, and hopefully, discover new laws of your own in the future!

Beyond the straightforward transfer of facts and skills, ambitious instruction has teachers and students making meaning of rich academic content, engaging authentic practical and intellectual puzzles, and creating new knowledge and capabilities in themselves and others. Globally, ambitious instruction sits at the very center of policy-driven educational improvement efforts, with schools and systems pressed to engage students in \"deeper learning\" and the development of \"21st-century skills.\" This course is both for individual leaders and for teams of leaders from a school, district/region, or system who aim to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for students, especially those historically underserved by public schools. For these teams, the course will function as a platform both for initiating their joint practice and for collaborating on issues that arise in their joint practice.

Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. Together, these two features make it possible for a data scientist to very quickly go from raw data to summaries, charts, and even full-blown reports. However, one deficiency with R is that traditionally it uses a lot of memory, both because it needs to load a copy of the data in its entirety as a data.frame object, and also because processing the data often involves making further copies (sometimes referred to as copy-on-modify). This is one of the reasons R has been more reluctantly received by industry compared to academia. The main component of Microsoft R Server (MRS) is the RevoScaleR package, which is an R library that offers a set of functionalities for processing large datasets without having to load them all at once in the memory. RevoScaleR offers a rich set of distributed statistical and machine learning algorithms, which get added to over time. Finally, RevoScaleR also offers a mechanism by which we can take code that we developed on our laptop and deploy it on a remote server such as SQL Server or Spark (where the infrastructure is very different under the hood), with minimal effort. In this course, we will show you how to use MRS to run an analysis on a large dataset and provide some examples of how to deploy it on a Spark cluster or a SQL Server database. Upon completion, you will know how to use R for big-data problems. Since RevoScaleR is an R package, we assume that the course participants are familiar with R. A solid understanding of R data structures (vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, environments) is required. For example, students should be able to confidently tell the difference between a list and a data frame, or what each object is generally a good representation for and how to subset it. Students should be familiar with basic programming concepts such as control flows, loops, functions and scope. Students should have a good understanding of how to write and debug R functions. Finally, students are expected to have a good understanding of data manipulation and data processing in R (e.g. functions such as merge, transform, subset, cbind, rbind, lapply, apply). Familiarity with 3rd party packages such as dplyr is also helpful. You will learn how to use MRS to read, process, and analyze large datasets including:  Read data from flat files into R\u2019s data frame object, investigate the structure of the dataset and make corrections, and store prepared datasets for later use  Prepare and transform the data  Calculate essential summary statistics, do crosstabulation, write your own summary functions, and visualize data with the ggplot2 package  Build predictive models, evaluate and compare models, and generate predictions on new data  Data is the foundation of the Digital Age.

Thus, many engineering teams develop software that supports their native language first, postponing support for other languages until \u201clater,\u201d when they think they will have the bandwidth. In other words, they don\u2019t plan ahead. The problem with this approach, which experienced developers have found out the hard way, is that it sacrifices budget, time, and opportunity. Redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every language or market can be a colossal effort. As this computer science course will demonstrate, planning ahead is far more efficient, and the marginal cost of supporting multiple languages from the get go is less than you may think. Harnessing international functionality in operating systems and programming languages makes writing code that works for multiple languages and markets much simpler than retrofitting existing code.

Specifically, you will learn how to translate supply chain terms and metrics into financial terms used in the C-suite. \r We will then proceed into the design and management of the information flow of a supply chain by examining three critical phases: procurement, production, and demand planning. Our primary objective here is to understand how a firm works with different partners in these three basic supply chain activities. \r The procurement lessons will cover basic approaches as well as more advanced techniques such as combinatorial auctions and supply contracts. The production lessons will concentrate on Material Resource Planning (MRP) and Fixed Horizon Planning. The Demand Management lessons will examine collaboration as well as Sales & Operations Plannings. \r After covering the design of the three flows (physical, financial, and information), we will turn to the design of the supply chain organization itself as well as the metrics. Real cases and examples from practice will be used throughout the entire course. \r In order to qualify for the XSeries certificate you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the three courses. When you sign up for a CTL.SC2x Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos.

Additionally, there are external forces and trends that can impact (positively or negatively) a supply chain\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. Understanding the dynamics and risks within supply chains, both large and small, is key to being a successful supply chain professional.  This course builds on the fundamental models introduced in SC1x and the design trade-offs covered in SC2x. It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry. We will divide the course into three sections.  First, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics. Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements. The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance.  Second, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk. Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions \u2013 from both within and outside of the supply chain. Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside.  Finally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships. Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.

However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other. Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today\u2019s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis. We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required. We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed. Finally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.

The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.  FAQ  What type of computing environment do I need for this course? You need to have a computer running one of the following operating systems: Microsoft Windows, version XP or greater (XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7) Apple OSX, version 10.2 or greater Linux - most distributions that have been released within the past two years should work In addition, you will need the ability to download, install, and run software on your computer.

The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.   This is Part 1 of a 2-part sequence on the basic tools of probabilistic modeling. Part 1 introduces the general framework of probability models, multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, conditional distributions, and various powerful tools of general applicability. Part 2 will then continue into further topics that include laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, and an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains).   The contents of the two parts of the course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class, which has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.   Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional \"theorem - proof\" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.   Photo by User: Pablo Ruiz M\u00fazquiz on Flickr.

Professor Y. Tzvi Langermann presents a case study that builds from a unique 15th-century volume in which three important medical manuscripts in Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic (Arabic in Hebrew characters) are sewn together. He will not only walk the student through the basics of medical knowledge training and practice in the Jewish Middle Ages and beyond, but he will also show how clues gleaned from the particular elements of a manuscript (such as marginal notes, mistakes, and handwriting) allow us to learn a great deal that we could not have gleaned from a pristine printed version. The course is made up of eight short video lectures (5-7 minutes each) that explore the fascinating highlights of an extraordinary manuscript.

Immunity is the body\u2019s system of protection from attack by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the \u201cenemies of human life\u201d have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.

The ancient gods of Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths still exist, but today, they have superpowers, human foibles and secret identities. They come from comic books and graphic novels, and have taken over pop culture on the stage, screen, video games, and animation. From Superman\u00ae and Spider-Man\u00ae, to The Avengers\u00ae and The Hulk\u00ae and beyond, who are these heroes? And, how have they evolved from folklore and myth, across all cultures and religions? Learn from Smithsonian and industry experts including:  Stan Lee, who was one of the creators of the modern superhero template. His early comics featuring Spider-Man, Iron Man\u00ae, The Hulk, Thor\u00ae, and The Avengers led Marvel to success. He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron. Michael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including The Dark Knight series, Lego\u00ae Movie, the animated Batman films and Batman\u00ae VS Superman.  In this self-paced course, we explore the following questions:  Why did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their \u201cGolden Age\u201d during World War II? Why did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades? How have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930\u2019s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices? Why was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950\u2019s? How did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20th Century? When and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools? When and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz? Finally, when and how did comic books become \u201ccool\u201d and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe?  The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today\u2019s world. As you learn about how cultural myths, world events, and personal experiences shaped the first superheroes, you will apply these frameworks to create your own superhero\u2013 or you can choose to do a deeper analysis on existing comic book heroes. This original project is required for certification and anything created by you as part of this self-paced course is the intellectual property of you and you alone. At last, fans, students and seekers of knowledge have the opportunity to enroll in the ultimate comic book course. The history and origins of the first superheroes and comic books, and how they changed over time  The evolution of American society from the Depression to today, as viewed through the lens of the comic book genre  How the current globalization and diversity of the next generation of superheroes impacts our storytelling across all mediums  How to apply historical examples to create superheroes for the present day  \u00a0  Find online courses in the humanities including the study of classical cultures, languages and literature.

New building materials and construction methods reflected changing times, and the radical contrast between tradition and modernism in the nation was clearly visible in Japan\u2019s architecture and politics. While experiencing intense Westernization pressures, Japan developed rapidly to rival the world\u2019s great powers, we will look at how Japanese architects developed their own version of Modernism. Initially, Japanese wanted to pursue the discoveries of the Franco-Swiss Le Corbusier and of Walter Gropius at the German Bauhaus. But soon, Japan also began to produce its own 20th-century architects and develop its own style. Following World War II, Kenzo Tange became the first Japanese architect in history to achieve international fame. In the last section of the course, we will present an interview-based case study titled \u201cExploring Tokyo Tech\u2019s Twenty-First Century O-okayama Campus.\u201d Tokyo Institute of Technology (aka Tokyo Tech) possesses its own unique and unbroken succession of practicing architects/professors, who design campus buildings. We will learn about Professor Kazuo Shinohara, one of the most prominent Japanese designers of the second half of the 20th century, and several of his renowned disciples from Tokyo Tech. This course aims to illustrate the present state of Japanese Modernist and postmodern building, as well as the distance covered over the past 150 years, including the 130-year history of Tokyo Tech itself.

Combinatorial mathematics is just the science to deal with combinations of discrete items. As an ancient field, the history of combinatorial mathematics can be traced back over 4000 years to the age of the Great Yu in ancient China. Today, combinatorial mathematics is regarded as the basis of computer science since the algorithms in programming heavily rely on the analysis of the discrete elements. Instead of relying on the traditional mathematical \"theorem - proof\" format, this course demonstrates various principles in an intuitive manner with ancient stories, the scenes of movies and even a magic show. What you\u2019ll learn:  The counting principles based on the basic operations \u201c+\u201d, \u201c-\u201d, \u201c*\u201d, \u201c/\u201d;  Generating functions Recurrent number serials such as Fibonacci number, Catalan number, and more Pigeon hole principles Inclusion and exclusion principles Polya counting based on group theory  This course is based on a highly regarded on-campus Tsinghua class called Combinatorics, and is ideal for students who are interested in mathematics or computer science.

China's architectural history spans thousands of years. In this course, we will explore the ancient cities of Chang'an of Han, Luoyang of Northern Wei, Chang'an and Luoyang of Sui and Tang, Kaifeng of Song and Dadu of Yuan, and delve into the history of the awe-inspiring ancient buildings that still grace the landscape of these bustling cities. The course will cover construction and aesthetics of these imperial palaces, religious structures, pagodas, tombs and gardens. We will study the basis of Chinese architecture, the wood framed building, as well as the brick and stone construction of many Buddhist pagodas and tombs. The course will culminate in an examination of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the ancient royal garden at the Chengde Mountain Resort, and the private gardens of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

La acumulaci\u00f3n de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Vel\u00e1zquez, etc.), tuvo r\u00e9plicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, N\u00e1poles, M\u00e9xico o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una s\u00edntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe cat\u00f3lica.

The monarchy of this Spain created the first global empire of History. The greatest literary works of this period, including La Celestina, Lazarillo de Tormes, were immediately translated in the first European and American printing houses. Spanish fashion was the trendiest at the Courts of Early Modern Europe. Spanish military and political treaties set the standard for political machinations of the era. In this period\u2014between the 16th and 17th centuries\u2014, Spain\u2019s society achieved excellence in Arts and Literature. Exceptional and talented people such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Vel\u00e1zquez, were drawn to Madrid. Literary academies, theatre productions and celebrations flourished in other big cities of the Empire as Seville, Lisbon, Barcelona, Naples, Mexico, and Lima. A synthesis of nations united for the loyalty to the Crown and the Catholic faith. In our tour through the Spain of Don Quixote, we will discuss the relationship between fantastic to real geography. Society was polarized between the privileged\u2014nobility and clergy\u2014and the poor and rogues. Humanism was cultivated in universities. Family, food, housing, games, and celebrations played a part in everyday life. In times of Don Quixote, the lights of Literature and Art geniuses shined upon the shadows of the Inquisition. Let\u2019s travel to this sublime culture of Spanish Golden Age. Spanish Golden Age History, with Don Quixote as common thread  Everyday life in the 16th and 17th centuries through society and culture  Don Quixote\u2019s period of time as if you lived then, through written and visual sources  How values of the Spain of Don Quixote have evolved over the History  Find online courses in the humanities including the study of classical cultures, languages and literature.

Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or \u201ceffortless action,\u201d the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals. This period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences. This course provides a full university semester\u2019s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last five weeks with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam. Part 2 builds upon Part 1 by exploring late Warring States thinkers such as the Confucian Mencius, the Daoist Zhuangzi, and the return to externalism in the form of Xunzi\u2014who believed Mencius betrayed the original Confucian vision\u2014and his former student Hanfeizi, a \u201cLegalist\u201d thinker who helped lay the foundations for the autocratic system that unified the Warring States into China\u2019s first empire. We will conclude with some reflections on what it means to study religious thought, and the thought of other cultures, in a modern, globalized world. Part 2 can be taken as a stand-alone course, but will be more comprehensible and rewarding with the background provided in Part 1.

No cabe duda de que entender c\u00f3mo se comportan las estructuras es fundamental para entender el mundo que nos rodea, para comprender la naturaleza y para juzgar mejor los progresos que ha hecho la humanidad a lo largo de la historia. Sin embargo, los ingenieros hemos fallado una y otra vez cuando hemos intentado explicar esta materia de forma que los no entendidos puedan entender su importancia. Este curso pretende saltar esa brecha existente entre los expertos en c\u00e1lculo de estructuras y los profanos utilizando un lenguaje asequible, empleando ejemplos hist\u00f3ricos y proponiendo ensayos sencillos que pueden hacerse en casa.

While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs\u2019 transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called \u201cdead donor rule\u201d and allow \u201corgan-donation euthanasia\u201d? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs. _ Entender los desaf\u00edos jur\u00eddicos y \u00e9ticos actuales que plantean los trasplantes de \u00f3rganos / Understand the current ethical and legal challenges raised by organ transplantation.

Or have you started a novel draft only to find your interest or confidence waning? In this course, the international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia\u2019s renowned MFA program introduce the essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts.  While ideas and inspiration are often enough to ignite interest in writing a novel, writers can quickly lose confidence, especially when their best efforts have inadvertently produced flat characters, waning conflicts, tangled plots and weak dialogue. Reaching your goal of writing (and perhaps, publishing) a novel requires an understanding of fiction\u2019s deeper mechanics and a familiarity with the specific craft elements that will help translate your creativity and imagination into compelling paragraphs, scenes and chapters. Through writing exercises aimed at developing new skills, concrete examples from published novels, feedback and discussion with fellow writers and opportunities to identify and strengthen weaknesses in their own projects, learners will broaden their knowledge of fiction craft as they explore creating memorable characters, the art of scene design, tactics for managing unwieldy plots and steps for writing layered and meaningful dialogue. Whether you\u2019re beginning your novel draft or nearing the end, this course is a unique opportunity to learn the essentials of strong fiction writing from award-winning authors sharing their proven methods and approaches. The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, those participating in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has a novel in progress.

This is an approach that more and more educators see as far more likely to ensure the success of Indigenous learners, as well as enhance the learning experiences of all students. Choosing reconciliation as a lens for rethinking policy and learning practices acknowledges that there are contradictions in the current curriculum of schooling that impact the success of Indigenous learners. Reconciliation in this course emphasizes changing institutional structures and personal and professional ideologies to create equitable and inclusive learning environments for Indigenous learners, and where all students should have opportunities to learn from Indigenous histories, traditions, and knowledges as part of a social justice education. Educators need to be able to respond to educational reforms that prioritize improved educational outcomes for Indigenous learners. In addition, educators must build the capacity of all learners to engage in relationships with Indigenous peoples based on intercultural understanding, empathy, and respect.

You will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course. Certificates can be uploaded directly to your LinkedIn profile.  FAQ How much effort is required? Since this is a design-based course, students in previous courses have put in between 3-25 hours/week, depending on their background, interest, and the level of complexity of their chosen project. There are also many optional modules in the course, completing all the optional modules increases the time required. What are the prerequisites for taking this course? Phot1x is targeted at an audience with a wide range of backgrounds who are committed to learning the material and completing the course design project. The prerequisites are introductory physics, and optics, for example an undergraduate optics or electromagnetics course. Background in microwave/RF would be an asset. No background with integrated optics is assumed. The course uses various computer software, hence a background in basic computer programming is beneficial (e.g., MATLAB, Python). Do I need to buy a textbook? The notes, videos and exercises are all sufficient to complete this course. The textbook is optional. Included in the course are several key chapters from the book \"Silicon Photonics Design\", by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg, published by Cambridge University Press. The full version (ebook or hardcopy) is available for purchase at www.cambridge.org/9781107085459. What are the fabrication details? Your devices will be fabricated on a Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with 220 nm silicon thickness, with a minimum isolated feature size of 60 nm. Each participant is allocated 410 \u00b5m x 605 \u00b5m of space, enough for &gt;10 devices each (more available on request).

El modelo de la sociedad industrial est\u00e1 dejando paso a un nuevo modelo de sociedad, a\u00fan difuso, en el que la capacidad de transformar la informaci\u00f3n en conocimiento es clave. Es f\u00e1cil deducir que para esta nueva sociedad emergente se necesita un concepto de educaci\u00f3n bien distinto al que requer\u00eda la sociedad industrial. Sin este cambio educativo dif\u00edcilmente se podr\u00e1 conseguir satisfactoriamente el cambio y, consecuentemente, instalarse adecuadamente en un mundo que va a alterarse radicalmente. El curso tiene dos objetivos. El primero es presentar el fen\u00f3meno de la transformaci\u00f3n de la sociedad que estamos viviendo y los fundamentos para definir el mundo que est\u00e1 emergiendo como el de la sociedad del conocimiento. La pretensi\u00f3n de la primera parte es disponer de un escenario suficientemente detallado y s\u00f3lido de lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo y superar as\u00ed la visi\u00f3n e interpretaci\u00f3n triviales que pueda haber sobre un nuevo modelo de sociedad. Sin esta buena base es dif\u00edcil fundamentar el siguiente objetivo del curso: el papel de la educaci\u00f3n. El objetivo de tratar la educaci\u00f3n en este curso es para presentarla en estrecha relaci\u00f3n con una intensa crisis cultural que inevitablemente tiene que sobrevenir para que no aumente el desajuste entre el mundo tecnol\u00f3gico -planetario, desigual y contradictorio- que hemos levantado y los valores culturales de otros tiempos con los que queremos mirar e interpretar el mundo de hoy y el que se avecina. As\u00ed que se tratar\u00e1 la estrecha relaci\u00f3n que hay y debe haber entre educaci\u00f3n y cultura. De igual modo se ver\u00e1 en el curso la relaci\u00f3n entre tecnolog\u00eda y educaci\u00f3n, no desde el punto de vista instrumental, sino cultural. La pretensi\u00f3n del curso es que de esta observaci\u00f3n del fen\u00f3meno actual de cambio, y de la interpretaci\u00f3n del papel de la educaci\u00f3n para la orientaci\u00f3n y control de ese cambio, surjan elementos inspiradores de acciones educativas precisas ajustadas a las m\u00faltiples realidades concretas desde las que se est\u00e1n sintiendo los desaf\u00edos de vivir en el siglo XXI. El planteamiento did\u00e1ctico del curso seguir\u00e1 la estructura de un viaje por el tiempo, por lugares y tambi\u00e9n por conceptos que haga ameno el recorrido durante las siete semanas. En cuanto a la parte textual, habr\u00e1 la experiencia de lectura de piezas multimedia concebidas y escritas para la lectura en pantalla, y especialmente en smartphones y tabletas. Disponer de unos elementos de an\u00e1lisis del momento actual.  Apreciar el valor de la educaci\u00f3n como palanca y como gozne. Como palanca para remover las resistencias al cambio cultural que se necesita. Y como gozne para que la transformaci\u00f3n de la sociedad gire en torno a unos valores que no reproduzcan el modelo actual.  Aceptar, para poder actuar en consecuencia, la incertidumbre y el riesgo del cambio y que bajo el nombre de sociedad del conocimiento (ya acu\u00f1ado y quiz\u00e1 por el excesivo uso, ya desgastado) pueden darse modelos de sociedad muy distintos, y algunos de ellos poco deseables.

El An\u00e1lisis de Im\u00e1genes o Visi\u00f3n por Computador es la capacidad de los ordenadores de analizar im\u00e1genes capturadas por una c\u00e1mara y obtener la informaci\u00f3n de los objetos que se hayan presentes en esa escena.

Otra caracter\u00edstica que ha cambiado recientemente es que hasta hace poco tiempo las t\u00e9cnicas de an\u00e1lisis de im\u00e1genes eran accesibles solamente a un reducido n\u00famero de especialistas. Los programas que se utilizaban eran costosos, con poca documentaci\u00f3n y que exig\u00edan equipos inform\u00e1ticos de gama alta.

What\u2019s more, the media often offers support for whichever opinions appear most popular at any given time. This leaves those of us who like to base our decisions on firm, provable facts feeling dizzy.   \u201cThe Science of Parenting\u201d addresses this confusion by moving beyond the chatter and opinion surrounding parenting, and by looking directly at the science. Parenting itself is far from a science. Nevertheless, scientists have conducted thousands of studies that can help parents \u2013 or future parents \u2013 make sensible, informed decisions.   One goal of this course will be to provide a survey of important scientific findings spanning a range of topics that are central to the lives of parents:   diet; sleep; discipline; learning; screen time; impulse control; vaccination.  We\u2019ll also explore ongoing mysteries, like what causes autism, and why so many children are allergic to peanuts.   Perhaps more important, this course will not only dig into existing science, but will also explore the underlying nature of parenting science itself. Often, scientists measure correlations: they ask how different parenting practices are related to different behaviors in children. But the claims they make from correlational data are often much, much stronger. For example, from correlational data, scientists often claim that parents cause the behaviors of their kids. This course will show how this type of error \u2013 common in the scientific literature \u2013 can explain a significant amount of the confusion present in the media and general public. We will discuss how to avoid the same error when evaluating science, and how to use the sum of available evidence to inform decision making.   The course\u2019s instructor, David Barner, is a leading authority on cognitive development. He is joined by leading experts on behavior genetics, vaccination, autism, lying, and spanking, as well as by real live parents who try to use science to inform their decisions. This class is suitable not only for parents, future parents, and grandparents, but also for professionals interested in health care, social work, and early childhood education who want to increase their knowledge and analysis skills. Core knowledge on topics including infant sleep, forms of discipline, breastfeeding, language and math learning, screen time, bilingualism, and autism;  Analytical and applied techniques, including how to compute the contribution of genetics to a trait, how to understand and compute correlations, and how kids can effectively study for tests;  Best practices for sleep training, discipline, and feeding.

Algunos de los temas que cubriremos:  Los astr\u00f3nomos modernos combinan datos de m\u00faltiples tipos de telescopios para crear im\u00e1genes compuestas de objetos en el espacio. Los agujeros negros son por definici\u00f3n imposibles de observar directamente usando telescopios de luz, ya que ninguna luz puede escapar de su extrema gravedad. La \u00fanica manera de estudiar los agujeros negros usando telescopios de luz es observar cualquier gas y polvo que caiga en ellos. Esto puede revelar informaci\u00f3n sobre un agujero, como la frecuencia con la que gira alrededor de su eje.  Comprensi\u00f3n de la gravedad.  En el siglo XVII, Isaac Newton propuso una ley universal de gravitaci\u00f3n que conceb\u00eda la gravedad como una fuerza entre dos masas (m1m1 y m2m2) separadas por una distancia rr seg\u00fan la ecuaci\u00f3n: F = Gm1m2r2F = Gm1m2r2 La teor\u00eda de Newton es muy exacta para la mayor\u00eda de las situaciones y es ampliamente utilizada hoy en d\u00eda. Sin embargo, Newton estaba preocupado por la acci\u00f3n a distancia, quer\u00eda entender c\u00f3mo dos masas se conocen y se influyen mutuamente sin enviar ninguna se\u00f1al. Este problema no se resolvi\u00f3 hasta que Albert Einstein propuso la relatividad general en 1916. En su nueva concepci\u00f3n la gravedad no es una fuerza, sino la geometr\u00eda del espacio-tiempo. Los objetos masivos causan que el espacio-tiempo se curve, y esta curvatura es lo que influye en el movimiento de otros objetos en el espacio-tiempo. El mensajero gravitacional de Newton result\u00f3 ser el espacio-tiempo en s\u00ed. Einstein se dio cuenta de que objetos masivos (no esf\u00e9ricamente sim\u00e9tricos) sometidos a aceleraci\u00f3n u oscilaci\u00f3n producir\u00edan distorsiones que se extender\u00edan a trav\u00e9s del espacio-tiempo como ondulaciones en un estanque. Estas ondulaciones se llaman ondas gravitacionales. Al igual que las ondas electromagn\u00e9ticas, las ondas gravitatorias transportan energ\u00eda y tienen amplitudes (llamadas tensi\u00f3n para las ondas gravitacionales) y frecuencias asociadas con ellas. Las ondas gravitatorias se representan a menudo como formas de onda, que demuestran su frecuencia y amplitud mientras que cambian con el tiempo. Las ondas gravitacionales interact\u00faan muy d\u00e9bilmente con la materia, pasando por todo esencialmente sin cambios. Esto es muy \u00fatil para la astronom\u00eda porque significa que cualquier se\u00f1al detectada permanece pr\u00e1cticamente inalterada desde cuando se gener\u00f3 en la fuente.  Hace no mucho tiempo, hace apenas un par de a\u00f1os, anunciamos en el 2016, que hab\u00edamos descubierto por primera vez ondas gravitacionales. En introducci\u00f3n a ondas gravitacionales vamos a explicar su significado, son una predicci\u00f3n de la teor\u00eda de Einstein de la teor\u00eda de la relatividad general, vamos hablar de la primera teor\u00eda de la relatividad especial despu\u00e9s de la relatividad general y de c\u00f3mo se producen o c\u00f3mo pensaba Albert Einstein que se produc\u00edan las ondas gravitacionales. Despu\u00e9s vamos a hablar de qu\u00e9 sistemas producen ondas gravitacionales, en realidad no sabemos producir nosotros ondas gravitacionales, sabemos que hay sistemas astrof\u00edsicos que producen las ondas gravitacionales. Es as\u00ed que hablaremos de agujeros negros, de estrellas de neutrones, del universo temprano produciendo ondas gravitacionales. M\u00e1s tarde hablaremos de c\u00f3mo se pueden detectar las ondas gravitacionales, que ha sido una \u00a0campa\u00f1a muy dif\u00edcil que ha tomado casi medio siglo; Pero hay detectores de distintos tipos, vamos a explicar los distintos tipos de detectores, y m\u00e1s en detalle los detectores que se usaron para detectar por primera vez, por segunda y por tercera vez, tambi\u00e9n, ondas gravitacionales. Y finalmente, el tema m\u00e1s interesante, es la astrof\u00edsica de las ondas gravitacionales que aprendemos porqu\u00e9 las buscamos, y c\u00f3mo podemos aprender de los sistemas que las producen, no solo midiendo ondas gravitacionales con distintos instrumentos, sino tambi\u00e9n midiendo otras ondas, ondas electromagn\u00e9ticas, u otras part\u00edculas producidas por los mismos sistemas.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.   By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.   Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.   Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field.

We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement. Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes. Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics.  This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:  Overview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade) Transformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade) OpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade) Raytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)  This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.  FAQ What is the format of the class? The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material.  Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count. Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can \"work ahead\" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them. What computer system do I need for the course? The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system. Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.? This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL. Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster. I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course? In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind. I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course? The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.

Para que una organizaci\u00f3n pueda avanzar en la direcci\u00f3n adecuada son necesarias dos cosas: saber a d\u00f3nde ir y orientar los esfuerzos de las personas que hacen posible el movimiento. En todos los grupos (familiares, deportivos, asociaciones...) existen personas que ejercen mayor influencia que otras y a las que se suele denominar l\u00edderes. En las organizaciones los l\u00edderes no s\u00f3lo se encuentran dentro de las estructuras formales de la organizaci\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n en los grupos informales de trabajo. Los l\u00edderes deber\u00edan crear y mantener un ambiente interno en el cual el personal pueda llegar a involucrarse totalmente en el logro de los objetivos de la organizaci\u00f3n, construyendo un puente entre el entorno externo y el grupo, las tareas que realizan y los procesos internos del grupo que permiten realizarlas. Ayudando as\u00ed a identificar, interpretar y alinear los requerimientos de los clientes internos y externos. Dentro de un contexto de organizaciones \u201cplanas\u201d con pocos niveles de mando, los l\u00edderes deben asumir las responsabilidades que tradicionalmente estaban repartidas entre las jerarqu\u00edas de direcci\u00f3n. Lo cierto es que los miembros del grupo necesitan un apoyo activo por parte del l\u00edder para poder cumplir sus responsabilidades con justicia y honestidad. Por ello, el papel del l\u00edder debe cambiar, pasando de ser un planificador o alguien que toma decisiones, a ser un entrenador, orientador, emprendedor y facilitador que anima y asegura una planificaci\u00f3n eficaz y una toma de decisiones distribuida. Un error muy com\u00fan en este proceso de cambio es que los l\u00edderes pasan de un extremo al otro, esto es, de un estilo \"ordeno y mando\" a la abdicaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, lo que se precisa de ellos es un papel situado en alg\u00fan punto intermedio entre ambos extremos. En este curso te ense\u00f1aremos a encontrar este punto adecuado que te convertir\u00e1 en un l\u00edder eficaz.

High-tech nations wage wars from a distance using satellite-guided weaponry while non-state military actors, terrorist organizations, and citizen journalists have increasingly added new voices and visual perspectives to the conversation about conflict. The ubiquity of smartphones, internet access, and social media transports the experience and complexity of war directly into our lives. Cyberspace offers greater freedoms and access to information at the same time as we discover a dramatic global rise of cyber espionage, internet censorship, and surveillance. In this course, we map this emerging new terrain where violent conflict, information technology, and global media intersect and where the old distinctions between battlefront and home front, between soldier and civilian, between war and entertainment, and between public and private are being redrawn.  Considering these changes, this course engages with questions surrounding:  The relationship between media, information technology, and war How violent conflict is presented in the media and the responsibilities of journalists during wartime The effect of instantaneous, worldwide reporting on battle and the politics of conflict How we can understand and critically engage with media and information technology  In order to engage with these questions, this course is taught through a number of conventional and unconventional forms of learning methods and activities. These include lecture videos, questionnaires, and discussion fora. But it also includes practical, experiential elements taught through crowdsourcing, individual research, critical viewing, media and image analysis, and surveys. Combined, these activities allow you to gain fresh and timely insights into what happens beneath the surface of the screen in front of you. They enable you to gain a deeper understanding of how the politics of today's wars play out on and behind the digital screens in our hypermediatized age. \u00a0  The history and evolution of global media technology as it relates to conflict  The major themes and trends of global media in times of war  Application of the history and major themes of global media to current issues  Skills to be a critical media consumer  Find online courses in the humanities including the study of classical cultures, languages and literature.

New Zealanders take pride in being islanders as it is part of their story, national identity and culture.    Remote from other landmasses, you will learn how the islands of New Zealand have a unique geology and form part of the Pacific \u2018Ring of Fire.\u2019 Our long history of remoteness has been expressed by a New Zealand poet as \u2018Distance looks our way.' But the idea of distance is a European one - who are we far away from? For the peoples of the Pacific we inhabit one group of islands in the Pacific, 'a sea of Islands.'   New Zealand is a bicultural nation. M\u0101ori voyagers named this chain of islands Aotearoa or land of the long white cloud.

The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to \u201cvisualize\u201d the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry\u2019s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo\u2019s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido. The course will cover the following topics in four modules:  Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources? Module 1: Black Ships & Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission. Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive \"Hibiya Riot\" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of \"imperial democracy\" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power. Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido & Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity.  The course is based on the MIT \"Visualizing Cultures\" website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (visualizingcultures.mit.edu).

In this lab-based computer science course, explore the complexities of embedded systems and learn how to develop your own real-time operating system (RTOS) by building a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity (BLE). An operating system (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS. However, as embedded systems have evolved, so have their complexities. To manage this, an RTOS is now required. Embedded systems are often deployed in safety-critical situations such as automotive, military, industrial, and medical applications. In applications such as communications and consumer electronics, response time and processing speed are important. A real-time system not only needs to arrive at the correct answer, but must also get the correct answer at the correct time. A RTOS manages a computer's resources so that tasks are performed in a timely mannner. In this computer science course, students will learn the design fundamentals of an RTOS from the bottom up and use these fundamentals to build practical real-time applications. We will provide a board support package (BSP), so students will be able to focus on the RTOS and Bluetooth network without needing prior experience in circuits and I/O device driver software. This is a hands-on project-based lab course, where you will incrementally build a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity. This course is intended for students and professional engineers wishing to improve their skills in the fields of embedded systems, product development, computer architecture, operating systems, and Bluetooth networks.

This course introduces the two primary methods used to determine the geometrical structure of molecules: molecular spectroscopy and gas electron diffraction. In molecular spectroscopy, molecules are irradiated with light or electric waves to reveal rich information, including:  Motions of electrons within a molecule (Week 1), Vibrational motions of the nuclei within a molecule (Week 2), and Rotational motions of a molecule (Week 3).  In the gas electron diffraction method, molecules are irradiated with an accelerated electron beam. As the beam is scattered by the nuclei within the molecule, the scattered waves interfere with each other to generate a diffraction pattern. In week 4, we study the fundamental mechanism of electron scattering and how the resulting diffraction images reveal the geometrical structure of molecules. By the end of the course, you will be able to understand molecular vibration plays an important role in determining the geometrical structure of molecules and gain a fuller understanding of molecular structure from the information obtained by the two methodologies.

Tackle the challenges in the transition towards a circular economy? In this course you will analyse what it takes to create a circular economy including sustainable supply chains. Circular economy challenge  The transition towards a circular economy is one of the biggest challenges in order to create a more sustainable society. This transition requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining socio-technical, managerial, and environmental considerations. Valuable resources often end up as waste. We challenge you to find and analyse examples of this in your own environment. You could consider possible solutions to reduce or recycle waste, but you soon realise that waste is not the only problem. Precious materials such as copper, gold and phosphorus are gradually disappearing. Water is becoming scarce, pollution of water and air is massive and a lot of food is thrown away. Right now we design products from cradle to grave: from production to consumption to waste, which is a linear model. But we should design products from cradle to cradle: in a closed loop whereby they don\u2019t become waste, but valuable resources again. And when we start thinking in circles, we might as well try to reinvent not just supply chains, but entire systems. Because that\u2019s what we have been doing with sustainability: we have been departing from the status quo, while cradle to cradle and circular pushes us to think outside the box. Conventional understanding of sustainability proposes activities defined in terms of decreasing and reducing, such as \u2018zero footprint\u2019, \u2018zero waste\u2019, reduction of pollution, reduction of energy consumption. The focus is on reducing negative impacts. We call this eco-efficiency, which is often seen as a goal in itself \u2013 we can keep doing what we do, just strive to do it less. Cradle to Cradle celebrates abundance; it recognises that people, just like ants and trees, are abundant and have a large impact on their environment. The challenge is to make this impact a positive one and we invite you to join this challenge! Systems approach to circular economy  In this course, we therefore take a systems approach to the circular economy, considering different stakeholder perspectives, their incentive structures, and their impacts on circular alternatives. The circular solutions will be identified by technological assessment using applied as well as emerging technologies. Since identifying and evaluating potential circular alternatives based on quantitative techniques is key in achieving sustainable solutions, you will also learn how to use life cycle assessment and agent-based modelling to assess the socio-technical and manageable challenges and environmental benefits of alternative solutions. By integrating all perspectives in a case study, you will learn how to comprehensively and critically assess strategies to transition towards a circular economy.

Natural disasters like this one can be seen throughout our Earth\u2019s history. They will continue to prey on all regions, bringing devastation when they strike. But are we so powerless? What if we could improve preparedness over the world and limit the devastation caused by coastal disasters? These are the questions we at Waseda University have been asking. Now we would like to share our experiences and achievements in disaster prevention with the rest of the world. In this environmental studies course, you will learn about coastal disasters. Using worldwide field surveys, you will develop an understanding of the nature of tsunamis and storm surges. You will learn how coastal areas are attacked, understand how human lives are lost and infrastructure destroyed. Using numerical simulations and hydraulic experiments, we will present you with different scenarios, teaching you about the mechanisms behind a coastal disaster. You will look at successful coastal disaster prevention concepts and methods. This will include defenses such as coastal dikes, as well as the implementation of essential evacuation plans.

In this research course, you will learn the underlying principles that are needed to conduct research from an engineering perspective. This course is designed for engineering students conducting postgraduate research work on engineering projects. The objective of the course is to translate current research methods, which are mostly from a social science perspective, into something more relatable and understandable to engineers. Our hope for this course is to go beyond the concepts to understand the actual reasons for doing research in a certain way. While engineers are the main target audience, non-engineers will find this information useful as well. The methods taught in this course will equip you with the knowledge needed to design, plan and construct your own research process.

Are you grappling with logframes and indicators that don\u2019t adequately tell the story of your program?   A Theory of Change (ToC) approach can help.   This course will provide you with a ToC toolkit to help assess any process of change that you may be developing. It is optimized for public and development managers, monitoring and evaluation practitioners, donor agencies, NGOs, academics, and other stakeholders.   A ToC approach helps you situate complex social and development interventions. ToC is both a process and a product for explaining the various contributors to change, and the multiple levels of outcomes that result from program implementation.   The course will introduce you to the theory of change approaches and principles. It will give you the tools to both understand existing theories of change as well as develop your own. You will also be able to connect a theory of change to logframes and other organizational tools for further monitoring and evaluation.

We\u2019ll focus on five topics in this course: 1. Introduction to Biobased Sciences Learn about the products that can be derived from biomass and the processes used to do so, compared to current fossil based products and processes. 2. Biorefinery Biorefinery deals with the challenge of extracting valuable biomass components and converting them to final products. To achieve this you first need knowledge of the different types of biomass, the molecules present and their chemical characteristics. Biorefinery is all about efficient processing. Aspects of processing include the harvesting, pre-treatments, conversion and separation technologies. 3. Consumer Behaviour Understand the challenges of moving towards a biobased economy and gaining consumer acceptance. How do consumers evaluate products? And how is their perception influenced by communication strategies? Understanding the basics of consumer science will help you to implement a consumer view when developing a product.  4. Biomass production A biobased economy runs on biomass. It is therefore important to understand which factors play a major role in crop growth, yield formation and quality. In this module you\u2019ll learn to identify design criteria for the production of biobased crops on both a crop and farm level. 5. Achieving Sustainability Delve into the true meaning of sustainability and how sustainability issues are linked to human activities. Biobased products are not always as sustainable as it seems on first glance. You\u2019ll learn that an understanding of the degree of sustainability requires a thorough analysis of a variety of factors and constituents. Students will be able to: \u00a0  Understand the concept and importance of the biobased economy and the value of biobased products.  Understand the factors and methods that can influence production of biobased crops;  Understand how the composition and chemical nature of biomass fractions determines the processing steps within a biorefinery;  Assess sustainability issues for a given biobased case'  Decide how to implement a consumer point of view during the development of a biobased product.
